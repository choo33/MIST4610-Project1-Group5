Problem Description

Queries:
1. Query 1 lists the total revenue collected for the current month. It also displays the total for each payment method (e.g., Credit Card, Cash, Online). The results are ordered by total revenue in descending order.

Query 1 allows managers to see which payment methods are the most commonly used by members and which methods bring in the most revenue during the current month. This information can help management identify member preferences and help decide which payment options to prioritize or promote. We listed the results in descending order to help management quickly identify the top-performing payment methods, which can influence financial planning in the club.

2. Query 2 identifies members whose payment amounts exceed the overall average payment across all members. It first finds the average payment using a subquery that retrieves the mean amount from the Payment table. The outer query then lists each qualifying member’s name, payment amount, and payment date. The results are ordered by payment amount in descending order.

Query 2 allows management to identify high-value members who spend more than the average club member. Recognizing these members is important for maintaining strong relationships and providing loyalty incentives or rewards. Having these insights can also help management find the characteristics of higher-spending members and develop targeted marketing strategies to bring in similar clients. Ordering the results by payment amount makes it easier to see which members contribute the most revenue to the club.

3. Query 3 lists all active members along with the name of the membership plan each one is enrolled in. It joins the Member, Subscription, and MembershipPlan tables to match members with their current subscriptions and plan names. The results are filtered to include only those with a valid status and are filtered alphabetically by the member's last name.

Query 3 enables managers to quickly view all current active members and which membership plans they belong to. It's useful for finding which plans are the most popular and to verify active memberships within the club. Sorting by last name makes it easy to locate a member.
